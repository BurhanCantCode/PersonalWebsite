    text: "Burhan is a natural leader, which I noticed from working with him at his first hackathon when he brought an international team of five strangers to work together seamlessly. He's also a voracious learner on everything related to software engineering and machine learningâ€”I can't think of any opportunity to further his education that he hasn't taken. He's done internships for companies in the US, taught himself and others AI and full-stack development, completed a ton of MOOCs and amassed quite a resume of collaborative work and a solid portfolio. And he's just getting started! This is the guy (not AI) who is going to make me obsolete pretty soon.",
